					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>A poodle is a formal dog breed which includes the standar poodle, miniature poodle, and the toy poodle. Poodles are hyperallergetic and they can live for 12 to 15 years.

Poodles are great for families with kids. They bite if they are scared. They compete in may tpyes of events inlcuding The Westminister Kennel Club Dog show and The world Dog Show.</p> 

					<p>Unlike most dogs, poodles have a sinlge layer coat made of dense, curly fur that rarly sheds. When poodles sheds their fur becomes tangled instead of it falling out which can lead to matting. Poodle come in many different colours such as white, black, brown, parti, sliver, gray, sliver beige, apricot, red, cream, sable, and patterns such as phantom and brindle. Some of the health problems that poodles have include Allison's disease, gatric dilatation volvulus, thyroid issues, tracheal collapse, eilepsy, sebaceous, juvenile renal disease, hip dysplasia, and cancer. The most common minor issue of these is ear infection. Ear infections are a problem in all poodle varities because their nonshedding coat grows into the ear canal, where it traps wax and dirt. Toy poodles have a lifespan of 14 to 14.5 years. Poodles are often cited as a hypoallergetic dog breed.  </p>
